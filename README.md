Hello! This project regarding Health Insurance is a data visualization analysis of certain 
factors affecting consumer rates. I decided to create this as insurance rates have been increasing 
for me personally, thus I decided it would be interesting to see what factors (other than economic standpoint)
can cause these rates to increase. To do so I utilize python and various packages such as pandas and
matplotlib to visually identify trends.
